# Coursera-Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning
This course also teaches you how Deep Learning actually works, rather than presenting only a cursory or surface-level description.

# Objectives :
- Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
- Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks 
- Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks 
- Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture
